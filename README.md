1. Project Overview
This presentation outlines insights and recommendations for optimizing inventory levels at T.T Inc, a major player in the consumer electronics industry. The goal is to leverage data-driven decisions to improve stock availability, reduce inefficiencies, and support strategic planning for 2025.

2. Objective
To develop a robust, insight-driven strategy for managing inventory based on product sales data, seasonal trends, and external economic factors.

3. Business Problem
