## 📊 Business Questions Answered

The following questions were analyzed using SQL and visualized for stakeholders:

| 🔢 Question ID | Business Question |
|---------------|-------------------|
| a) | What is the total number of units sold per product SKU? |
| b) | Which product category had the highest sales volume last month? |
| c) | How does the inflation rate correlate with sales volume for a specific month? |
| d) | What is the monthly correlation between inflation and sales quantity in the last year? |
| e) | Did promotions significantly impact product sales quantity? |
| f) | What is the average sales quantity per product category? |
| g) | How does GDP affect the total sales volume? |
| h) | What are the top 10 best-selling product SKUs? |
| i) | How do seasonal factors influence sales across categories? |
| j) | How many promoted products exist per category, and what are their average sales? |

---

## 💡 Key Insights

✔️ **Top SKUs Identified**: Key products consistently outperform others — essential for stock prioritization.  
✔️ **Promotions**: Mixed impact; some categories perform better without promotions.  
✔️ **Seasonality**: Sales are only mildly influenced by seasonal factors — but still worth monitoring for peak periods.  
✔️ **Inflation Trends**: Weak-to-moderate correlation; may influence strategic pricing models.  
✔️ **GDP Effect**: Slight correlation; not a strong predictor of total sales volume.  
✔️ **Average Sales by Category**: Electronics and Home Appliances perform best.
